# /etc/chrony.conf 
# By JoshB at Mesosphere, 9-13-18
#
# FYI, USEFUL DIAGNOSTICS COMMANDS
# 
# sudo chronyc makestep
#   Skips slewing (small clock changes) and makes a single step (big change). 
#   This is useful as a troubleshooting tool if DC/OS will not start and states
#   time is not in sync. However this chrony.conf file should avoid this.
#
# chronyc activity
#   Shows recent activity, similar to logs
# 
# chronyc tracking 
#   Shows if chrony is synchronized to an NTP server
#
# chronyc sources
#   Shows status of NTP sources, the * indicates what server was chosen as the source
#
# chronyc sourcestats
#   Shows statistics of sources
#
# chronyc ntpdata
#   Digs deeper into the NTP data
#
# AN INTERESTING NTP CONFIGURATION PROBLEM
#
# https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/404046/chrony-3-1-refuses-to-sync-with-ntp-server
#
# BEGINNING OF CONFIGURATION FILE
# 
# Use Google's NTP servers
# Note Google utilizes leap second smearing. https://developers.google.com/time/smear
# NTP servers that do and do not utilize it should not be mixed.
#
# If your firewall does not allow outbound access, or if internal NTP servers are used
# add them here instead, and below in the initstepslew section.
#
# Note NTP is designed to handle network latency by measuring it, so a local NTP server
# is not as important as commonly assumed, https://blogs.n1zyy.com/n1zyy/2008/04/29/long-distance-ntp/
# Use of multiple NTP servers is far more important, a minimum of 4 is recommended. 
#
# The iburst directive enables an initial burst of activity to quickly synchronize, however it
# places a greater load on the NTP servers.
# https://chrony.tuxfamily.org/manual.html#server-directive

# Only upon startup, make a step (rapid change) to the system clock
# if it differs more than 0.1 seconds from these 2 NTP servers.
# This will pause chrony until this is accomplished.
# The initstepslew directive is functionally similar to a combination of the makestep and 
# server directives with the iburst option. The main difference is that the initstepslew 
# servers are used only before normal operation begins and that the foreground chronyd 
# process waits for initstepslew to finish before exiting. This is useful to prevent programs 
# started in the boot sequence after chronyd from reading the clock before itâ€™s stepped.

# Record the rate at which the system clock gains/losses time.
# This can be a useful log for diagnostics.

# Normally chrony will cause the system to gradually correct (slew) any time offset, by slowing down
# or speeding up the clock as required. In certain situations, the system clock may be so far
# adrift that this slewing process would take a very long time to correct the system clock.
# DC/OS will not start until the system clock and NTP time are nearly the same, because DC/OS
# is a distributed OS and time synchronization is very important.
# This setting allows the system clock to be stepped (large change) vs slewed (small change)
# during the first 60 seconds if its offset is larger than 100ms.
# The initstepslew directive above should make this unnecessary.

# Enable kernel synchronization of the real-time clock (RTC).
# Note there are always two clocks in Linux, a real-time clock (RTC) aka hardware clock,
# which is independent of the OS and runs even when the computer is shut down,
# and also a system clock, also known as a software clock, that is maintained by the kernel and
# its initial value is based on the real-time clock. Once the system is booted and the system
# clock is initialized, the system clock is completely independent of the real-time clock.
# This directive causes chrony to set the real-time clock (hardware clock) on an ongoing basis.
# This can be useful in virtualized environments.

# Enable hardware timestamping on all interfaces that support it.

# Increase the minimum number of selectable sources required to adjust

# Ideally 4 NTP servers are used, and the below directive can be enabled.
